# MagicalHat
This Repository is for beginner like myself to learn and explore the power of github ;-)

I've started to learn PowerShell script about an year ago. Without much coding experience, I thought I can create this space for myself and others to learn and share. 

In this MagicalHat domain, I have created a simple script called "GetCommentsOnly". This script will filter out all the codes and leave the comments only. So, what you see is the pure sudo codes that may help for any beginners to read the logic behind the codes. It is much easier to read because there is no codes between the comments. The goal is to help beginners to reexamine and refine the logic on the concepetual level without worrying about the code itself.
