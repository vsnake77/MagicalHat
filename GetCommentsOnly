Disclaimer: This program is only work for powershell script currently. The block comments <# #> cannot be in the same line due to the
following:  when the program found either <# or #>, it would stop searching and make decision for the entire line base on what it found.

COMMENTS EXTRACTOR -- Comments extractor will only take comments from the scripts. Therefore, you will get the entire comments 
without codes. It may help people to focus on the logic and bigger picture of the script. It may also decipline and make people better 
on how to comments. And that may help to become a better coder.
